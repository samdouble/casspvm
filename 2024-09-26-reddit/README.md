## Have I found a pervert?
Soooo... I forgot to create this post a while ago, but I had it in some old note, so here we go.

I will give you a little bit of context so you can understand how I got to this theory; I don't want to appear too dramatic.

So the story goes like this:

I little more than a year ago I moved to Montr√©al, I found a nice place (won't specify exactly where but it's in the old part/downtown/old port part of the city [somewhere in that range]); since I came alone and I barely knew anyone here, I (as many people do when they move) went to google maps to find some places in which I could buy some groceries, food, cleaning stuff, etc.

I like to see the reviews and photos of the places I on the app, something that caught my attention was the fact that there were some poor quality photos, weird angles and, girls with their backs turned or in the distance (but then I really didn't give it importance, I just thought it was weird).

r/montreal - Look at those girls in those weird angles, not noticing anything.

As I said, my alarm was not triggered and I didn't give it importance.

Then I kept looking to find some more places, and I saw something that looked familiar: a name (which I won't post because I don't want to fall into false accusations) and again those weird-angled photos.

r/montreal - Again, weird-angled photos and girls from behind.

Here I began to suspect... I accessed this guy's maps profile and I noticed a pattern; to not make the story too long I will just post some photos I found (there are many more).

r/montreal - I censored the face of that girl eating because I thought it was really creepy, there are more photos of here from different angles.

Am I exaggerating? Please let me know; in case I'm being just a paranoid let me know and I will delete the post.
